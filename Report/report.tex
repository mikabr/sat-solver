\title{Solving Semantic Analogy Problems Using ConceptNet}
\author{Mika Braginsky and Will Whitney}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We implemented a system for solving SAT analogy problems, using ConceptNet. The system attempts to find the relationship between the target pair of words (such as \emph{mason}:\emph{stone}) and each option pair (such as \emph{teacher}:\emph{chalk}, \emph{carpenter}:\emph{wood}, \emph{soldier}:\emph{gun}, \emph{photograph}:\emph{camera}, \emph{book}:\emph{word}), scores the similarity of each option's relationship to the target's relationship, and selects the option with the highest score. On a dataset of 374 questions, it achieves an accuracy rate of 28.6\%.
